## Description

Implement the core graph engine that serves as the foundation for NPR diagrams. This engine must efficiently handle graph data structures using adjacency lists, provide spatial indexing for precise hit detection during user interactions, and implement a robust type system for edge/node compatibility checking.

The engine should be optimized for computational efficiency rather than human readability, supporting the complex graph manipulations required by the Neo-Peircean Relations calculus while maintaining smooth real-time performance for interactive diagram construction and proof manipulation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Graph data structure implemented with efficient adjacency list representation
- [ ] Spatial indexing system (quadtree or R-tree) for O(log n) hit detection
- [ ] Type system for nodes and edges with compatibility validation
- [ ] Graph traversal algorithms (DFS, BFS, cycle detection)
- [ ] Serialization/deserialization for graph persistence
- [ ] Memory-efficient node/edge management with object pooling
- [ ] Collision detection for overlapping elements
- [ ] Spatial queries (point-in-shape, bounding box intersections)

## Technical Details

### Graph Data Structure
- **Representation**: Adjacency lists for memory efficiency and fast iteration
- **Node Types**: Support for NPR-specific node types (boxes, junctions, terminals)
- **Edge Types**: Typed edges with direction, multiplicity, and constraint information
- **Mutability**: Immutable updates where possible for predictable state changes

### Spatial Indexing
- **Algorithm**: Quadtree or R-tree based on performance testing
- **Use Cases**: Mouse hover detection, selection regions, collision avoidance
- **Dynamic Updates**: Efficient insertion/removal as graph elements move
- **Query Types**: Point queries, range queries, nearest neighbor

### Type System
- **Node Compatibility**: Rules for which edges can connect to which nodes
- **Edge Validation**: Type checking for source/target compatibility
- **Constraint Propagation**: Automatic validation of graph well-formedness
- **Error Reporting**: Clear feedback for invalid configurations

### Performance Requirements
- **Hit Detection**: Sub-millisecond response for typical diagrams
- **Graph Operations**: Constant-time for common operations (add/remove elements)
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient pooling to prevent garbage collection pauses
- **Scalability**: Handle diagrams with hundreds of nodes without performance degradation

## Dependencies

- **Depends on**: [13] Core Architecture Setup
- **Blocks**: [16] Formula Mode Development
- **Enables**: All subsequent UI and interaction tasks

## Effort Estimate

**Large (L)** - 24 hours
