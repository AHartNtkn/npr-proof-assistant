# Task 005: Visual Polish and Animations

**Name:** Visual Polish and Animations  
**Status:** TODO  
**Created:** 2025-08-29T20:11:17Z  
**Updated:** 2025-08-29T20:11:17Z  
**GitHub:** Issue #5  
**Depends on:** [16, 18]  
**Can run in parallel with:** [17]  
**Conflicts with:** None

## Description

Integrate React Spring for physics-based animations and create the polished, satisfying visual experience that makes the proof assistant feel like a "fidget toy". Focus on smooth transitions, personality animations, and tactile feedback that enhances the user's connection to the mathematical objects.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] React Spring integrated with smooth physics-based animations
- [ ] Mode switching has satisfying transition effects
- [ ] Hover feedback provides clear visual cues
- [ ] Click interactions have tactile, satisfying responses
- [ ] Personality animations add character without being distracting
- [ ] Performance remains smooth during complex animations
- [ ] Animation system coordinates with proof engine operations

## Technical Details

### Animation Categories
- **Transition Animations**: Mode switching, view changes
- **Interaction Feedback**: Hover effects, click responses
- **Personality Animations**: Subtle bounces, organic movement
- **Process Indicators**: Loading states, computation feedback
- **Error Animations**: Clear but non-intrusive error states

### React Spring Integration
- Custom hooks for graph element animations
- Spring configurations optimized for mathematical precision
- Gesture-based animation triggers
- Coordinated multi-element choreography

### Performance Considerations
- Animation batching for complex scenes
- Reduced motion accessibility support
- Frame rate optimization techniques
- Memory-efficient animation cleanup

## Dependencies

**Internal:**
- Task 003 (Canvas Rendering System) - Required for visual foundation
- Task 004 (Proof Mode Engine) - Required for interaction coordination
- Shared event system and state management

**External:**
- React Spring for animation framework
- RAF (RequestAnimationFrame) for smooth rendering
- CSS-in-JS or styled-components for dynamic styling
- Performance monitoring tools

## Effort Estimate: M (16 hours)

### Breakdown:
- React Spring integration and setup: 4 hours
- Mode transition animations: 4 hours
- Hover and click feedback systems: 3 hours
- Personality animation development: 3 hours
- Performance optimization: 2 hours

## Definition of Done

- All interactions have appropriate visual feedback
- Mode transitions feel smooth and purposeful
- Animations enhance rather than distract from mathematical work
- Performance metrics meet targets (60fps minimum)
- Reduced motion preferences respected
- Animation system integrates seamlessly with proof operations
- User testing confirms "fidget toy" appeal
- Accessibility standards maintained throughout
