# Task 006: NPR Axioms Implementation

**Name:** NPR Axioms Implementation  
**Status:** TODO  
**Created:** 2025-08-29T20:11:17Z  
**Updated:** 2025-08-29T20:11:17Z  
**GitHub:** Issue #6  
**Depends on:** [18]  
**Can run in parallel with:** [15]  
**Conflicts with:** None

## Description

Implement the complete set of Neo-Peircean Relations axioms from the academic paper, creating the axiom palette UI for proof mode and building the validation rules that govern their application. This task brings the mathematical foundation of NPR into the interactive proof assistant.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Complete NPR axiom set implemented from paper specifications
- [ ] Axiom palette UI provides intuitive browsing and selection
- [ ] Validation rules prevent mathematically invalid applications
- [ ] Preview visualizations show axiom effects clearly
- [ ] Axiom categories organized logically (cartesian, linear, structural)
- [ ] Custom NPR features (boxes, relations) fully supported
- [ ] Performance optimized for large axiom sets

## Technical Details

### Axiom Categories
- **Cartesian Bicategory Axioms**: Plus and minus operations
- **Linear Adjunctions**: Structural rules and transformations
- **First-Order Logic Encodings**: Quantifier and connective rules
- **NPR-Specific Rules**: Box operations and relation manipulations
- **Derived Rules**: Commonly used compound transformations

### Implementation Architecture
- **AxiomDefinitions**: Formal rule specifications with patterns
- **AxiomPalette**: UI component for browsing and selecting rules
- **ValidationEngine**: Rule applicability checking
- **PreviewRenderer**: Visual preview of axiom effects
- **CategoryManager**: Organization and filtering system

### Key Features
- Pattern matching for axiom application sites
- Context-sensitive axiom filtering
- Visual axiom documentation with examples
- Batch axiom application capabilities
- Custom axiom definition support

## Dependencies

**Internal:**
- Task 004 (Proof Mode Engine) - Required for axiom application infrastructure
- Graph manipulation and validation systems
- Canvas rendering for axiom previews

**External:**
- LaTeX paper source for axiom specifications
- TikZ diagrams for visual reference
- Pattern matching libraries
- Mathematical notation rendering

## Effort Estimate: L (32 hours)

### Breakdown:
- Axiom specification and encoding: 12 hours
- Axiom palette UI development: 8 hours
- Validation rule implementation: 6 hours
- Preview visualization system: 4 hours
- Testing and mathematical verification: 2 hours

## Definition of Done

- All paper axioms accurately implemented and validated
- Axiom palette provides efficient rule discovery
- Validation prevents all invalid mathematical operations
- Preview system clearly shows transformation effects
- Axiom organization supports efficient proof construction
- Mathematical correctness verified against paper examples
- Performance benchmarks meet requirements for large proofs
- Documentation links axioms to paper sections
