# Task 004: Proof Mode Engine

**Name:** Proof Mode Engine  
**Status:** TODO  
**Created:** 2025-08-29T20:11:17Z  
**Updated:** 2025-08-29T20:11:17Z  
**GitHub:** Issue #4  
**Depends on:** [14]  
**Can run in parallel with:** [16]  
**Conflicts with:** None

## Description

Build the core engine for proof mode functionality, including axiom application logic, preview systems, and validation. This task creates the fundamental proof manipulation capabilities that distinguish proof mode from formula building mode.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Axiom application engine processes rule applications correctly
- [ ] Hover-to-preview shows axiom effects before application
- [ ] Validation prevents invalid axiom applications
- [ ] Proof history tracks all steps with undo/redo capability
- [ ] Mode switching preserves graph state appropriately
- [ ] Error handling provides clear feedback for invalid operations

## Technical Details

### Core Components
- **AxiomEngine**: Core logic for applying transformation rules
- **PreviewSystem**: Real-time preview of axiom effects on hover
- **ValidationLayer**: Rule validation and constraint checking
- **ProofHistory**: Step tracking with bidirectional navigation
- **ModeManager**: Coordinates between formula building and proof modes

### Key Algorithms
- Graph pattern matching for axiom application sites
- Constraint satisfaction for valid rule applications
- Efficient graph transformation with rollback capability
- Preview computation without mutating main graph state

### Integration Points
- Extends graph manipulation from task 002
- Provides foundation for axiom UI (task 006)
- Coordinates with animation system (task 005)

## Dependencies

**Internal:**
- Task 002 (Graph Manipulation Engine) - Required for base graph operations
- Shared graph data structures and transformation utilities

**External:**
- TypeScript for type safety in rule definitions
- Immutability libraries for safe graph transformations
- Event system for mode coordination

## Effort Estimate: L (24 hours)

### Breakdown:
- Axiom application engine: 8 hours
- Preview system implementation: 6 hours
- Validation logic and constraints: 4 hours
- Proof history and undo/redo: 4 hours
- Integration and testing: 2 hours

## Definition of Done

- All axiom applications preserve graph invariants
- Preview system shows accurate transformation results
- Validation prevents all categories of invalid operations
- Proof history supports complete step navigation
- Mode switching maintains consistent application state
- Comprehensive test coverage for all rule applications
- Integration tests with graph manipulation layer
- Performance benchmarks for complex proof scenarios
