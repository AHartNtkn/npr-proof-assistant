**Updated:** 2025-08-29T20:11:17Z  
**GitHub:** https://github.com/ahart/NPRAssistant/issues/8  
**Depends on:** [15, 17, 19]  
**Can run in parallel with:** none (final task)  
**Conflicts with:** none  

## Description

Create a comprehensive distribution strategy for the NPR Proof Assistant that makes it accessible across multiple platforms and use cases. This includes building a Progressive Web App (PWA) for offline use, an Electron desktop application, an embeddable web component for integration into other platforms, and automated deployment to GitHub Pages.

The distribution system should support the local-first architecture while enabling easy access, installation, and embedding across different environments.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Offline functionality with full feature parity
- [ ] App manifest with proper icons and metadata
- [ ] Install prompts and native app-like behavior
- [ ] Background sync for when connectivity returns
- [ ] Push notifications for collaborative features (future)

### Desktop Application (Electron)
- [ ] Native window management with proper menus
- [ ] File system integration for direct file operations
- [ ] System tray integration with quick access
- [ ] Auto-updater with delta updates
- [ ] Platform-specific installers (Windows MSI, macOS DMG, Linux AppImage)
- [ ] Deep linking support for opening .npr files

### Embeddable Web Component
- [ ] Self-contained component with isolated CSS
- [ ] Configurable API for host application integration
- [ ] Event system for communication with parent page
- [ ] Responsive design for various container sizes
- [ ] Multiple embedding modes (readonly, interactive, full-editor)
- [ ] Documentation and examples for integration

### GitHub Pages Deployment
- [ ] Automated CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- [ ] Progressive deployment with rollback capability
- [ ] Custom domain configuration with HTTPS
- [ ] Analytics integration for usage tracking
- [ ] Error monitoring and crash reporting
- [ ] Performance monitoring and optimization

## Technical Details

### PWA Configuration
```json
{
  "name": "NPR Proof Assistant",
  "short_name": "NPR Assistant",
  "start_url": "/",
  "display": "standalone",
  "background_color": "#ffffff",
  "theme_color": "#2563eb",
  "icons": [
    {
      "src": "/icons/icon-192.png",
      "sizes": "192x192",
      "type": "image/png"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Service Worker Strategy
- **App Shell**: Cache core application files
- **Dynamic**: Cache graphs and user data
- **Network First**: API calls and live updates
- **Cache First**: Static assets and libraries
- **Stale While Revalidate**: Non-critical resources

### Electron Architecture
```typescript
// Main process
interface DesktopApp {
  windowManager: WindowManager;
  fileHandler: FileHandler;
  menuBuilder: MenuBuilder;
  updater: AutoUpdater;
}

// Renderer process communication
interface IPCMethods {
  openFile: (path: string) => Promise<GraphData>;
  saveFile: (path: string, data: GraphData) => Promise<void>;
  showSaveDialog: () => Promise<string>;
}
```

### Web Component API
```typescript
interface NPRAssistantElement extends HTMLElement {
  // Properties
  graph: SerializedGraph;
  mode: 'formula' | 'proof' | 'readonly';
  theme: 'light' | 'dark' | 'auto';
  
  // Events
  onGraphChange: (event: GraphChangeEvent) => void;
  onModeChange: (event: ModeChangeEvent) => void;
  onSave: (event: SaveEvent) => void;
}
```

### Deployment Pipeline
```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    steps:
      - name: Build application
      - name: Run tests
      - name: Build PWA
      - name: Build Electron apps
      - name: Deploy to Pages
      - name: Create GitHub release
```

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies
- **Task 005**: Complete UI system for all distribution targets
- **Task 006**: Full visual polish for professional appearance
- **Task 007**: Persistence layer for offline functionality
- Service Worker APIs for PWA functionality
- Electron framework and native dependencies
- GitHub Actions for automated deployment

### Platform Requirements
- Modern browser support (Chrome 80+, Firefox 75+, Safari 13+)
- Node.js 18+ for build system
- Platform-specific build environments for Electron
- GitHub repository with Pages enabled

### External Dependencies
- Certificate authority for HTTPS (Let's Encrypt)
- Code signing certificates for desktop installers
- CDN for global distribution (GitHub Pages/Cloudflare)

## Effort Estimate
**Medium (M)** - 20 hours

### Breakdown
- PWA implementation and service worker: 6 hours
- Electron desktop application: 6 hours
- Web component development: 4 hours
- GitHub Pages deployment and CI/CD: 4 hours

## Definition of Done

### Distribution Targets
- PWA installs and works offline on mobile and desktop
- Electron app runs natively on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Web component integrates cleanly into third-party sites
- GitHub Pages deployment is automatic and reliable

### Quality Assurance
- All platforms maintain feature parity with web version
- Performance meets or exceeds web version on all platforms
- Security review passed for all distribution methods
- Accessibility standards met across all platforms
- Cross-platform file compatibility verified

### User Experience
- Installation is one-click on all supported platforms
- Offline mode provides full functionality without degradation
- File associations work correctly on desktop platforms
- Web component is easy to integrate with clear documentation
- Updates are seamless and non-disruptive

### Operations
- Automated deployment requires no manual intervention
- Error monitoring provides actionable insights
- Performance monitoring identifies optimization opportunities
- Analytics provide usage insights for future development
- Rollback procedures tested and documented

## Notes

This final task transforms the NPR Proof Assistant from a development project into a production-ready application. The multi-platform approach ensures maximum accessibility while maintaining the local-first philosophy.

Pay special attention to the embedding API design, as this will likely be how many users first encounter the tool through integration into educational platforms, research papers, and mathematical software.

The deployment pipeline should be designed for long-term maintenance with minimal ongoing effort, as this will likely become a community resource rather than a actively developed commercial product.
