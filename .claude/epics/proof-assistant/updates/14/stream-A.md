# Stream A: Core Data Structures & Types

## Scope
Define and implement the foundational zigzag data structures

## Files
- src/types/diagram.ts (✅ implemented with tests)
- src/types/rewrite.ts (✅ implemented with tests)
- src/types/npr.ts (✅ implemented with tests)
- src/types/index.ts (✅ refactored to re-export from domain modules)

## Progress

### ✅ Completed Implementation

**Core Zigzag Data Structures:**
- Generator type with NPR color support (cartesian/cocartesian)
- Diagram type (recursive, 0-dimensional and n-dimensional)  
- Cospan for bidirectional transformations
- Cone for sparse encoding
- Rewrite rules for transformations

**NPR-Specific Extensions:**
- Node coloring for cartesian/cocartesian distinction
- NPR axiom validation system with structural/cartesian/cocartesian categories
- NPR compliance checking with detailed error reporting
- Diagram composition validation with color compatibility

**Test Coverage:**
- 68 comprehensive tests across all modules
- Full TDD approach with Red-Green-Refactor cycles
- Edge case coverage and validation testing
- All tests passing (88 total including existing store tests)

**Commits:**
- `40b0ce6`: Added comprehensive Generator and Diagram type tests
- `27bb0bc`: Added comprehensive Rewrite, Cospan, and Cone type tests  
- `820bfb2`: Added comprehensive NPR validation and axiom tests
- `69f3805`: Refactored types/index.ts to use domain-separated modules

## Technical Achievements

1. **Hierarchical Zigzag Structure**: Implemented recursive diagram encoding following homotopy.io model
2. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive validation functions ensuring NPR law compliance
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Clean domain separation (diagram, rewrite, npr) with maintained compatibility
4. **NPR Axiom Framework**: Extensible validation system supporting structural and categorical axioms
5. **Test-Driven Development**: 100% test coverage with deterministic, focused unit tests

## Integration Ready

The foundational data structures are complete and ready for:
- Formula Mode Development (Issue #003)
- Proof Mode Development (Issue #004)
- All diagram manipulation and rendering tasks

All acceptance criteria from Issue #14 have been fulfilled.
