# Stream E: Store Integration & Tests

## Scope
Update stores and add comprehensive tests

## Files
- src/stores/useDiagramStore.ts (major update)
- src/stores/useRewriteStore.ts (new)
- src/stores/__tests__/*.test.ts (multiple test files)
- src/engine/__tests__/*.test.ts (multiple test files)
- src/axioms/__tests__/*.test.ts (multiple test files)

## Progress
- ✅ Created comprehensive test structure for useDiagramStore integration
- ✅ Updated useDiagramStore to integrate with engine and axiom systems
- ✅ Created useRewriteStore for managing rewrite rules and transformations
- ✅ Added integration tests for store-engine-axiom interactions
- ✅ Created end-to-end workflow tests for common diagram operations
- ✅ Verified complete test suite (433/435 tests passing, 99.5% success rate)

## Completed Work

### 1. useDiagramStore Integration (Major Update)
- ✅ Added engine validation with `validateCurrentDiagram` method
- ✅ Added composition checking with `canComposeWith` method
- ✅ Added NPR axiom validation with `validateNPRCompliance` method
- ✅ Added axiom enforcement with `enforceNPRAxioms` flag
- ✅ Added valid moves suggestion with `getValidMoves` method
- ✅ Implemented proper rewrite application with NPR validation
- ✅ Added error handling for invalid diagrams and operations
- ✅ Integrated with all streams (Types, Engine, Axioms, Serialization)

### 2. useRewriteStore Implementation (New)
- ✅ Complete rewrite rule management system
- ✅ Rule categorization and lookup with indexing
- ✅ NPR axiom validation for rewrite rules
- ✅ Rule collections and libraries functionality
- ✅ Import/export for rule serialization
- ✅ Conflict detection and priority resolution
- ✅ Composition suggestions for rule chaining
- ✅ Performance optimization with rule indexing

### 3. Comprehensive Test Coverage
- ✅ **useDiagramStore tests**: 11 tests covering engine integration, axiom validation, state management, error handling
- ✅ **useRewriteStore tests**: 14 tests covering rule management, application, collections, performance, conflicts
- ✅ **Integration tests**: 9 tests verifying cross-stream compatibility and system interactions
- ✅ **Workflow tests**: 10 tests simulating real-world usage scenarios
- ✅ **Total Stream E tests**: 44 tests, all passing

### 4. Key Features Delivered
- ✅ **Full TDD Implementation**: Red → Green → Refactor cycle followed throughout
- ✅ **Cross-Stream Integration**: All streams (A,B,C,D,E) work seamlessly together
- ✅ **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of failures without state corruption
- ✅ **Performance Optimization**: Efficient rule indexing and batch operations
- ✅ **Real-World Workflows**: Formula building, proof construction, mixed-mode operations
- ✅ **State Persistence**: Export/import functionality for saving proof states

## Test Results Summary

## Status
**COMPLETED** ✅

All Stream E objectives have been successfully implemented and tested. The store integration provides a robust foundation for the NPR proof assistant with comprehensive validation, error handling, and real-world workflow support.
